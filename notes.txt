Possibly have potency change based on position, i.e. in the "eye" of the storm, potency is quartered or something like that

Every fight has a base potency for all elements - a level 20 fight should have fire surfaces that scale to threaten level 20 characters

status effect ideas:
magnetism
burning
poison
blind
chilled
frozen
numb


some status effects need context of the world. therefore, two rounds will be done per turn:
-Individual status effects on that entity's turn
-World-wide status effects that loop over entities and apply them with the world context (magnetism needs to work like this)

Possibly put in a clause where the potency of a fire status effect is decreased by the potency of a water ability
